### Curriculum Vitae for Blessing Nyathi

### Motivation letter

```markdown
I am a focused individual who believes in goal oriented targets to achieve both organizational and personal goals.
I have very good communication and people skills due to interaction with a lot of end users in my line of work. I am bilingual in English and have developed an appreciation of diverse cultures. I attained a Diploma in Software Engineering and have completed the Cisco Certified Network Associate with Business & Computing Examinations (London). I have been involved in challenging projects in my previous firms of employment with Cutlet Investments, S.I.T.A and Zimbabwe Leaf Tobacco (Pvt) Ltd. Examples include the S.I.T.A call centre support project which involved rollout and setup of computer labs of over a network of up to 500 users. I am also a member of the Institute of Information Technology Professionals South Africa.
I hope to further my knowledge and growth through more exposure in the IT industry and study further with time. My ultimate goal is to be able to start my own IT firm after gaining more experience and depth. My career path is to focus towards IT project development and networking with a bias towards CISCO Hardware. I am very technically inclined with a strong understanding of networking, routing protocols and server infrastructures. With a stern foundation of computer architecture and hardware construction I have worked a lot on the windows platform including server 2003 to most windows operating systems. My experience has given me a strong bias towards proficient troubleshooting skills, project design development and implementation and also a general good customer service approach to clients. I am currently in search of employment in an organization where I can learn and grow in any of the following titles: Network Engineer, Network Administrator, Network Installations Engineer, IT Technician, IT Engineer, IT Security Administrator, Systems Analyst, Network (LAN) Administrator or Desktop Support Engineer.

I believe I can grow within your firm and make a meaningful contribution. Good leadership and attainable objectives have always been a motivating factor for me. I hope to grow in culture, spirit, knowledge and depth as an individual by having a point of orientation and growth when I get a chance to migrate and settle in a different and challenging environment.
